            <h2><u>Description</u></h2>
            <p>A dish featuring fettuccine noodles coated in a rich, creamy Parmesan cheese sauce, topped with sliced or diced cooked chicken. It's a popular American Italian-inspired dish known for its creamy texture and savory flavor. While the original Italian Alfredo was just pasta, butter, and Parmesan, the Americanized version often includes heavy cream, garlic, and other additions like chicken. </p>

            <h2><u>Ingredients:</u></h2>
                <ul>
                   <li>1 package of refrigerated cheese tortellini</li> 
                   <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                   <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cubed</li>
                   <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                   <li>0.5 pound sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                   <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
                   <li>2 cups heacy whipping cream</li>
                   <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                   <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
                   <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>
            
            <h2><u>Steps:</u></h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add tortellini. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tortellini float to the top and the filling is hot, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>

                    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken breast in hot oil until no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>

                    <li>Melt butter in another skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic powder until mushrooms begin to soften, about 3 minutes. Stir heavy cream into mushrooms and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese, parsley, and salt. Continue to cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute.</li>

                    <li>Stir tortellini and chicken into mushroom-cream sauce. Simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
